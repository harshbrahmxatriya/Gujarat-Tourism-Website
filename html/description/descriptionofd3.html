Gomti Ghat consists of steps leading to the Gomti creek, which is also a holy place for pilgrims to take a dip in the river to get rid of sins. The ghat has a number of small shrines dedicated to the Samudra (God of the Sea), Saraswati and Lakshmi. Other notable temples in the ghat area are: The Samudra Narayana temple (also known as Sangam Narayana temple), which is at the confluence of the Gomti creek with the sea; the Chakra Narayana temple where there is stone with imprint of a chakra as a manifestation of Vishnu; the Gomati temple which has an idol of the river goddess Gomati said to have been brought to earth by sage Vasishta.

On the banks of river Gomti, there is a Shiva temple, as well as smaller shrines of Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Krishna's friend Sudama around the ghat, where pilgrims have worshipped for at least 100 years. One can also hire a boat and move across the river to get a panoramic view of Dwarka.

Gomti Ghat is situated at the mouth of the river. A bath in these waters is believed to purge the soul. The solemnity of this belief contrasts with the lively atmosphere of boys jumping into the waves and turning somersaults as people photograph them.Decorated camels,tea stands,and bearded men selling seashell jwelry by the water add to the ambience. The banks are dotted with innummerable shrines dedicated to Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Samudra (God of the Sea).
