Sidi Bashir Mosque was located in the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Due to its unique construction, the minarates of mosque are also called Jhulta Minar or Shaking Minarets.<p>

Sidi Bashir Mosque in 1866 was constructed by Sidi Bashir, a slave of Sultan Ahmed Shah. A conflicting story is that the mosque was built by Malik Sarang, a noble in the court of Muhammed Begada, another Sultan of Gujarat. The mosque was completed in 1452.Only the minarets and arched central gateway remain; the body of the building was destroyed in 1753 during the war between the Marathas and Khan of Gujarat Sultanate.

Two minaretes of ruined mosque, now in Ahmedabad railway station, 1866 .On the north side, as the train enters the station, are the two tallest minarets in Ahmedabad. All traces of their mosque and the memory of its name and date are gone. The style and material of the minarets point to the close of Mahmud Begada's reign (1511), or perhaps rather later. Though much damaged, especially near the foot, the stairs inside the minarets may still be used.An Englishman made an attempt to demolish one of the minarets of the mosque, but all in vain. He did so to unravel the mystery behind the swaying of minarets. The mechanism that leads to vibration is still a mystery. An interesting thing about Jhulta Minar is that, it can even withstand the pressure of fast moving trains that pass from a distance not lying very far from the minaret.This minar was built layer by layer that is why it can resist that much shaking without collapsing. Its around 600 years old.
