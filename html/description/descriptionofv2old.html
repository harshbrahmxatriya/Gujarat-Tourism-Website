Galteshwar, situated on the confluence of the rivers Mahi and Galti hosts a Shiva temple from the Solanki era. About 16 km from the temple town of Dakor, the place is declared as ancient and cultural heritage site by the ASI. Thus, elevating Galteshwar as a picnic cum pilgrimage destination near Anand, Nadiad or Vadodara.The eight sided temple is an excellent model of red stone carving. Built in the Solanki era (10 to 13th century), the foundation as well as the adroitly carved figures are still intact.
<br>
The temple building is designed so peculiarly that the Galti river flows underneath and (believed to) constantly sprinkles water on the Shiva-Ling.This temple is one of the most intricately carved temples here in India. It belongs to Lord Shiva and is characterized by the presence of a richly carved 8 sided wall. This wall has been used like a canvas with the carvings of human figures, gods, goddesses, gandharvas or celestial beings, doli or palanquins, nautch girls or dancers etc. Each of these figures is richly carved and people feel as if they will come to life any moment. All the important milestones that are present in the life of a person from birth to death are depicted in a very interesting and beautiful manner. The significance of the temple increase as it is built at the confluence of the two rivers that is Galati and Mahi. <br>
Consequently, our ancestors were no less skillful than the Egyptians or the Romans.
