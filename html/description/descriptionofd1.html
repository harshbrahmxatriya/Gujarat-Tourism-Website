The Dwarakadhisa temple, located in the heart of Dwarka, is also known as Jagat Mandir
(meaning Temple of the World). It is a Vaishnava temple. It was built by Raja Jagat Singh Rathore
, hence it is called Jagat Mandir. The temple is at an elevation of 12.19 metres (40.0 ft) above 
mean sea-level. It faces west. The temple layout consists of a garbhagriha (Nijamandira or
Harigraha) and an antarala (an antechamber). The existing temple is
dated to 16th century. It is a five storied edifice built over 72 pillars 
(sandstone temple with 60 pillars is also mentioned ). The temple has an assembly hall
or audience hall. There are two important entrances to the temple, one is the main entry door 
which is called the Moksha Dwar (meaning "Door to Salvation") and the exit door which is known
as the Swarga Dwar (meaning: "Gate to Heaven").

The main deity deified in the sanctum is of Dwarkadeesh, which is known as Trivikrama form of
Vishnu and is depicted with four arms. On the chamber to the left of the main altar is the deity 
of Balarama, elder brother of Lord Krishna. The chamber to the right houses the images of 
Pradyumna and Aniruddha, son and grandson of Krishna. In several shrines surrounding the central 
shrine there are images of Radha (Krishna's companion), Jambavati, Satyabhama, Lakshmi, Devaki 
(Krishna's mother), Madhav Raoji (another name for Krishna), Rukmini, Jugal Swaroop (name for 
Krishna), Lakshmi Narayana, and Sita.</p>

<p> temple spire rises to a height of 78 metres (256 ft) and a very large flag with symbols of 
Sun and Moon is hoisted on it. The flag, triangular in shape, is of 50 feet (15 m) length. 
This flag is changed four times a day with a new one and Hindus pay a huge sum of money to 
hoist it by purchasing a new flag. The money received on this account is credited to the 
trust fund of the temple to meet the operation and maintenance expenses of the temple.</p>

<p>
The temple is also the location of Sharda Peeth, one of the four peeths (religious centers) 
established by Adi Shankaracharya (686-717) who pioneered unification of Hindu religious 
beliefs in the country. It is a four storied structure representing four peeths established 
by Shankaracharya in different parts of the country. There are paintings on the walls here 
depicting the life history of Shankaracharya while the dome has carvings of Lord Sshiva in 
different postures.</p>
