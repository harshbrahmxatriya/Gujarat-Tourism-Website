The Rukmini Devi temple, dedicated to Rukmini, Krishnaï¿½s chief queen, is located in Bet Dwarka, 
2 kilometres (1.2 mi) away from Dwarka. The temple is said to be 2,500 years old but in its 
present form it is inferred to belong to the 12th century. It is a richly carved temple 
decorated with sculptures of gods and goddesses on the exterior with the sanctum housing 
the main image of Rukmini. Carved naratharas (human figures) and carved gajatharas (elephants) 
are depicted in panels at the base of the tower.</p>

<p> temple stands 2 km away from Dwarka City. The local explanation given for this distance is an old legend. They say, once Lord Krishna and his wife Rukmini went to the sage Durvasha to invite him for dinner at Dwarka. He agreed on the condition that Krishna & Rukmini would have to pull his chariot instead of any animal. The couple happily obliged. While pulling the chariot, Rukmini became thirsty so Lord Krishna prodded his toe into the earth to draw a spring of the holy Ganga water. Rukmini took a sip without offering Durvasha. Annoyed by her impoliteness he cursed Rukmini that she would be separated from her beloved husband. Hence Rukmini temple is located 2 kms away from Dwarka's Jagat Mandir. Maybe 2500 years old, but its domed mandapa and stepped sanctuary cannot be older than the 12th century in its present form.

<p> exterior of the Rukmini Temple is richly carved. It has a panel of sculpted naratharas (human figures) and a panel of sculpted gajatharas (elephants) at the base. The traditional spire of the main shrine contrasts strongly with the hemispherical dome of the pavilion. The garbhagriha (inner sanctum) has a recessed seat on which the present image of Rukmini, wife of Lord Krishna, was consecrated. The usual sculptures of god and goddesses, along with male and female figures, are seen on the exterior of the shrine.
