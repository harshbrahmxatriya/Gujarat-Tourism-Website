Patola Sarees are a double ikat woven sari, usually made from silk, made in Patan, Gujarat, India. The word Patola is the plural formâ€”The sigular is patulu. They are very expensive, once worn only by royalty and the aristocracy, they are popular and in demand from those whocan afford them. Velvet patola styles are also made in Surat. Patola-weaving is a closely guarded family tradition. There are three families left in Patan that weave these highly prized double ikat saris. It can take six months to one year to make one sari.

To create a patola sari, both the warp and weft threads are wrapped to resist the dye according to the desired pattern of the final woven fabric. This tying is repeated for each color that is to be included in the finished cloth. The technique of dying both the warp and weft before weaving is called double ikat. The bundles of thread are strategically knotted before dyeing. Patola saris from Patan are renowned for their colorful diversity and geometrical style.

Royal history<br>
Patola has a royal history. Silk weavers of the salvi caste from the states of Karnataka and Maharashtra chose Gujarat as the home for their renowned patola fabric. It is believed that salvis went to Gujurat in the 12th century with the intention of acquiring the patronage of the Solanki Rajputs, who ruled all of Gujarat and parts of Malva and south Rajasthan at the time, with Anahiwad Patan as the capital. Legend says that over seven hundred patola weavers came to the palace of Raja Kumarapala. At that time the ruler used to dress in patola silk himself on special occasions. After the decline of the Solanki empire, the salvis founded a rich trade in Gujarat. Patola saris quickly became a sign of social status among Gujarati women and girls, especially as part of stridhan, items that a woman can claim as her own property within a marital household.

	Design and pattern<br>
There are four distinct patterns which are woven primarily in Gujarat by the salvi community. In Jain and Hindu communities, double ikat saris with entire designs of parrots, flowers, elephants, and dancing figures are generally used. In Muslim communities, saris with geometric designs and flower patterns are typical, being worn mostly for weddings and other special occasions. Maharashtrian Brahmins wear saris woven with plain, dark colored borders and body, and a bird design called Nari Kunj.
